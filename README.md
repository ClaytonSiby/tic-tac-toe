## Rules

- First player starts by selecting a valid number from 1 to 9 to place his mark instead of the selected number 
- Second player selects after.
- In order to win the game, a player must place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- If any player enters number not in a range of 1 to 9 or letter or some symbol, they will get the error message and we be asked to enter another number.
- If any player enters number which is marked on the board, they will get the error message which say that that place is take on the board.

## The following example game is won by the first player, X:
